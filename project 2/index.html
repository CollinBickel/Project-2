    <br>
    <p align="left-center">
        The MLB is one of the oldest sports leagues in the United States, so it is quite safe to say they have quite the history. They have many memorable things, from memorable games, memorable moments, and countless legends of the game. Throughout this page I hope to go into some details about the history of the MLB.

    <h2>
        The Beginning
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        The MLB was formed in 1903 when the two U.S. professional leagues, the National League and the American league merged. 1903 was the first year of the modern world series between the Boston Red Sox, at the time the Boston Americans, and the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates won the first game but ended up losing the series, back then it was a best-of-nine series and the Americans, the Red Sox, won 5-3.

        The Dark Ages
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        The dark ages are an era of baseball loved by many but hated by some, and I am of the camp of hating. I am talking about the steroid era. While at the time it may have been entertaining for some, in the end it resulted in a mess, records broken by cheaters, should they be inducted into the Hall of Fame? And other queestions.

        The Modern Day
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Now we're in the modern day, an era defined by hard throwers, homeruns, strikeouts, and nasty pitchers. In the modern day hitters focuses have shifted, where in the 80's people focused on hits, batting average, rbi's stolen bases, and of course homeruns. Now in the modern day teams couldn't care less about your batting average, they want homeruns, a high ops, a high obp, and stolen bases are still valued, especially with the recent rule change to make the bases bigger and limiting pickoffs, but they still aren't as valuable as they used to be. Hitter's have began focusing on homeruns, and homeruns have spiked, more homeruns getting hit now than ever before. That fact is due to the change in swings and data, launch angle and exit velocity. Now, let's change to pitching. Pitching analytics have come such a far way that teams will keep a 8.61 era pitcher, Corbin Burnes in his rookie year, and stick with them as if they can fix those prblems then they will have an elite pitcher on their hands. The biggest change, at least analyticaly is <a href=Spinrate.html>spin rate</a>, spin efficiency, and extesnion. These things are what can define a good pitcher, look at any elite pitcher and they will, at a minimum, have two of those analytics at an elite level. That is also simply ignoring the historic jump in velocity, back in the early 2010's a mid 90's fastball, say for example 95, was considered a fire baller, now adays 95 represents the average velocity. There are companies, for example Tread Athletics, that have optimized pitchers and their arsenals to the point hitting is historically harder than ever.
