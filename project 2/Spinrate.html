        Spin Rate: And why it is so important
    </h1>

    <h2>
        The Basics of Spin Rate
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Spin rate, is simply the rate of which the ball spins, this is measured by advanced camera's and computers who put the number into rpm's, rotation per minute. Now there are 4 types of spin, backspin, which is essential to a good fastball. Top spin, the spin put into a curveball to make it drop faster and late. Side spin, the  ball will drop and the ball will move towards the spin. Gyro, bullet spin, or a spiral, like a football, a baseball thrown with Gyro spin won't move, it will only drop. Now you don't want a high spin rate on all pitches as a couple are specifically designed to not spin much, namely knuckleball's and splitters which due to their lack of spin they move randomly.
