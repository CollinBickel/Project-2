    <h2>
        The Founding
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        The NBA was founded on June 6, 1946 as the Basketball Association of America, BAA. The BAA changed it's name on August 3, 1949 after merging with the National Basketball League, NBL.

        The Different Era's
    </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>
        The early days
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        I will catagorize this particular section by the existince being pre 60's. The inarguably greatest player of the 1940's is George Mikan. The early days, well up until the 2000's was big man centric, since the bigger you were the easier the close shot was. As we move into the 50's not much of the game plan changed but the greatest player was yet again George Mikan but he had a challenger, Bob Petit.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>
        The 60's
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        The 60's is where the league begins to learn what a star player is. This decade is highlighted by names such as Wilt Chamberlin, Bill Russell, Jerry West, and Oscar Robertson. It is one of the most impressive decades in nba history and was a catalyst for years of basketball to come.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>
        The 70's and 80's
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Now I am lumping these two together as it would simply make more sense. This was the era of the Lakers vs Celtics rivalry, this was the definitive peak of it with all time classic matchups. Now one of the many notable changes of these two decades is the addition of the three point line, which at the time didn't change too much but it gave smaller guys a chance to be more effective.  At the same time big men still dominated the league and the paint with offenses focused inside the arc instead of outside of it. Notable names range from Magic Johnson and Larry Bird to Kareem and the rest of the show time Lakers. The 80's were also the beginning of one of the most dominant careers of all time, Michael Jordan.

    <h2>
        The 90's
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        One of the most entertaining times to ever watch basketball. You had prime MJ and the bulls, Allen Iverson, Kobe and Shaq. One of the most highly regarded eras.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>
        2000's
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        This was the beginning of an era and the motivation behind many modern hoopers. Big names such as Shaq, Lebron, Kobe, DWade, and Kevin Durant thrived. It also began the superteam narrative, the argument that the celtics with Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, and Paul Pierce. But one look throughout the history of the league easily disproves that notion as super teams have been around since the introduction of modern basketball.

    <br>
    <h2>
        The 2010's
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Now I won't be including the 2020's as that decade isn't over with yet but we can talk about the 2010's. The 2010's was the most revolutionary time in basketball history all behind one man, Stephen Curry. Alone Curry proved that the 3 pointer was as a matter of fact worth more than a 2 point shot, crazy right? Who knew 3 was more than 2. Anyway he led one of the greatest and most dominant teams of all time, breaking the single season record for wins at 73. But I would argue he wasn't the greatest of the decade, that would be Lebron. Now lets get to naming some amazing players, of course we have the afforementioned Lebron and Curry but we also have, Durant, Kobe, Kyrie, Embid, Giannis, Kawhi, Paul George, and Damian Lillard.
